# Bewitchethlon
A **two player co-op game** where both of you are **phantoms** escaping from a tomb after stealing a pharaohs body, where one moves the corpse and goes through **plataforming avoiding obstacles** while the second phantom should try his best to succed on a game of **tetris** because that how minds works. The tomb its of course haunted by the original owner of the body and tries to catch you, he can throw thundershocks, forcing you both to **switch roles**. If the ghost catch you it's game over so better run. Also if you loose the tetris it's also game over. You win by getting to the end of the level.

## General
### Ectoplasm bar
As a team you share an ectoplasm bar, when it fills out by actions made by both players, serves as a power bar. When it's full, one of you chooses to make a special action (described on detail later).

### The big bad ghost
It will hunt you both through the level, catching up speed as it goes. It will randomly struck lightning on the player forcing you to change gameplay constantly (after a slow-mo). I will show up on a minimap on top of the screen the distance between the BBG and the players, if it catches you is game over.

## Race
### Controls
You move the character with both horizontal directional arrows on a 2d-plane, jump with the up arrow and drop down fast with the down arrow that you can also crouch. You have two buttons for punching (punch 1 and punch 2) for both arms, and a dash button (also on air). You can mix up both punches for a mega punch, dash and punch for a charged punch and dash and down button for a slide. By pressing the slide and both punches with a filled up ectoplasm bar you can perform a super ghost dash, passing throw everything on a high speed.

### Mechanics
From the things you can find during the run are boobytraps on the floor, triggering arrows, spikes, and boulders. Enemies like flying beetles, snakes and spiders and mummies on sarcuphagoses. You find various objects to destroy like doors, chests and crates. Getting hit make random blocks fall on the tetris side. Killing enemies generates ectoplasm.

## Tetris
### Controls
You have all the modern controls from tetris, move from side to side, pull down, fast drop, left and right spin, and hold.

### Mechanics
The better your tetris (lines destroyed) the most you fill up the ectoplasm bar, by pressing the down, left and right directions with the filled bar you clean up to 3/4 of the screen. If you loose on tetris, it's game over, and your head explodes.
